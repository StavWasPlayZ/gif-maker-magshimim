# Magshimim Gif Maker

The you-know-what gif maker project thingy you have to do in Magshimim sem B.  
Use it per your own convinience, dear comrade ðŸ«¡  

Do note my own implementation and take on this project and source code - that may differ from the usual, conventional one.

## About the Software
<img src=https://github.com/StavWasPlayZ/gif-maker-magshimim/assets/89315181/14f0fe35-2270-455c-9cd5-5882fe933e60 width="500" alt="Example usage of the swoftware">

A GIF maker that cannot actually produce GIFs.  
> ...Yeah it just displays them  
> I did not do that bonus-

The software primarily utilizes [OpenCV 3.4.0](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) as the image processor,
as well as [dirent 1.24](https://github.com/tronkko/dirent/releases/tag/1.24).

---

After loading some images from your machine into the program, you may:
- Play them as a looping sequence of images
- Reverse the order of frames
- Remove a frame
- Modify the duration of individual or all frames
- View current loaded frames

You may additionally save your GIF projects as files to later re-load into the software
without having to manually do all the annoying work again.

## Additional Features
The available optional bonuses
- Applying filters
  - Black & White
- The preview âœ¨loopsâœ¨ <small>_(this is for some reason not taken for granted)_</small>

### Even More Additional Features
- Custom Working Directories
  - This directory will be the starting point of all relative paths (`./`) specified in the program.
- Export individual frames
